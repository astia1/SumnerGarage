                  Construction begins later this year,

                  Some improvements for pedestrians and bicyclists are finished, 
                  including sidewalk and lighting enhancements in the station 
                  area and a new sidewalk and multi-use path on the Traffic Avenue/ SR 410 interchange. 
                  Additional improvements will be built with the garage, 
                  including a new pedestrian plaza adjacent to the platform area.

                  The new parking garage, located on the site of Sumner Station‚Äôs current surface parking, will have 4.5 levels and approximately 600 stalls. The garage will border Harrison Street on the south, extending from the station platform on the west to neighboring properties on the east, spanning over Station Lane. There will be surface parking on Harrison Street and north of the garage.

                  A new plaza will be added between Station Lane and Academy Street. The plaza will be accentuated with a paving pattern and tree mounds to create pathways connecting the garage to the platform.

                  To accommodate buses turning into and out of Station Lane at
                  Thompson Street, we will be widening the northwest corner of
                  the intersection and moving the crosswalk from the southwest
                  corner to the southeast corner of the intersection.

                <p>
                  Sound Transit has contributed $7.5 million to the City of Sumner to make walking, 
                  rolling, and bicycling to the station and in the area easier and safer. 
                  This work, which is already complete, includes sidewalk ramps and lighting 
                  enhancements in the station area and a new sidewalk and multi-use 
                  path on the Traffic Avenue/ SR 410 interchange. In addition, 
                  the City of Sumner recently completed new bicycle lanes on Academy Street, 
                  helping more local residents get to the station by bicycle.

                <p>
                  We will be replacing the bicycle lockers at Sumner Station
                  with new on-demand
                  <a href="https://www.bikelink.org/" target="_blank"
                    >BikeLink lockers</a
                  >, which can be rented for $0.05 per hour. By having a more
                  flexible locker arrangement, we expect more people can
                  conveniently ride their bicycles to the station and store them
                  securely. The new lockers will be located on the north end of
                  the platform.

                            As transit and passengers speed past the parking structure, the angled fins (screening) create a sense of movement that echoes the patterns of native riparian grasses.                            </p>

                            The fa√ßade allows natural light to filter through at varying degrees, enlivening the interior spaces throughout, and delighting the eye of travelers within the structure, as well as those passing by at the exterior.

                            At the ground level, a mix of materials, including metal screening, perforated box-rib metal panels and brick, along with landscaping, evokes a design language from Sumner‚Äôs historic downtown. Generous canopies and a seating area recessed into the building provide refuge from inclement weather.

                            The open design pattern sheltering the parking structure is inspired by natural elements found in the forests of the Pacific Northwest. The unique screening creates dynamic interchanges of light and shadow, acting as both windbreak and sunshade while still allowing natural ventilation.                           
                            <p>
                              The intermittent horizontal bands emphasize the activity and movement around the structure, while providing visual breaks in the overall building height. Textured board-formed concrete walls modulate the building‚Äôs length with changes in material and height.

                            The south entrance portal is marked by signage integrated into the canopy, creating a dedicated entry point for buses to safely pass through. Brick wraps around the building continuing to line the pedestrian path along Station Lane.

                        The City of Sumner zoned most streets near the station as "RPZ-3", which means only residents with a residential parking pass are allowed to park for more than three hours. When parking is reduced during construction, we recommend all passengers use alternate options, such as parking at Bonney Lake Park-and-ride, parking at Puyallup Station, applying for an HOV parking permit, or walking or bicycling to the station.

                        Sounder runs primarily on tracks owned by the BNSF Railroad, 
                        used heavily for freight movements. 
                        In addition to regular weekday service, 
                        we provide special event trains for select events, like some Seahawks, 
                        Sounders FC, and Mariners games. See the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.soundtransit.org/ride-with-us/event-service">event service schedule</a>. As well, 
                        we are updating the Sounder South Strategic Plan this year 
                        and considering whether to prioritize adding new trips rather than longer trains. 
                        New trips, which would depend on agreement with BNSF, could be on weekends, 
                        or weekday mid-day or evenings. <a target="_blank" href="https://soundersouth.participate.online/">Take our survey by Oct. 29!</a>

                        Trains traveling northbound in the morning and southbound in the afternoon (peak direction) generally use the primary platform on the east side of the tracks, near most of the parking and the bus loop. Morning southbound trains and afternoon northbound trains (reverse peak direction) generally use the platform on the north side of the tracks. A station agent is on site when trains are running and can direct passengers to the right track or notify them if there are last-minute track changes.                       </p>

                  Sounder S Line trains offer dependable, 
                  traffic-free travel between Lakewood and Seattle. 
                  We run 13 round trips on weekdays, and it takes a little over 40 minutes to travel from Sumner to Seattle. 
                  For details, read our <a href="https://www.soundtransit.org/sites/default/files/documents/schedule-sounder.pdf" target="_blank">schedule</a>. We also run trains for select special events like Seahawks, 
                  Sounders FC and Mariners games. Adult fares range from $3.75 to $5.75 one way, 
                  fares for seniors and low-income individuals are lower, and all youth 18 and under ride free.

                  Powered by clean-burning,

                  While Sound Transit owns the trains and stations and provides security, 
                  BNSF operates Sounder and Amtrak provides maintenance.

                  <p>Do you work in Sumner‚Äôs industrial area? A new shuttle service may be for you! The City of Sumner launched the Commuter Connector in early 2023 to give workers a direct connection from Sumner Station. The Connector meets Sounder trains and runs every 20 minutes, when Sounder is running. It then drops employees off at their worksite and brings them back to the station again when it is time to return home.
