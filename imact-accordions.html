          Parking for transit riders will be significantly reduced for
          approximately two years, to make room for garage construction. At
          least 110 stalls will always be available, including the 68 stalls on
          the lot north of Maple Street next to the railroad tracks.

              Carpool parking permits are available free of charge to groups of
              two or more transit riders who regularly drive together to catch
              the train. Permits give you access to reserved parking areas when
              arriving with two or more transit riders in a vehicle during
              morning rush hour. The reserved area will be in the lot north of
              Maple Street.

          The parking layout at the station will look different during phases of
          work.
        </p>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Phase 1 Construction layout</strong></p>
        <p>
          During this phase, which is expected to last up to several months, we
          will close most parking south of Maple Street, apart from an area at
          the southwest corner of the station - see map below. This southwest
          corner will include ADA stalls for passengers with disabilities, as
          well as 15-minute drop-off/pick up stalls. The 68-stall lot north of
          Maple Street will remain open and will include spaces reserved for
          carpool permit holders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Buses will enter the station from Maple St. and exit on to Harrison
          St. Bus stop locations may change, and we will notify riders in
          advance.

              parking at the southwest corner of the site will be closed, and
              stalls on Narrow Street will be opened. The Narrow Street area
              will include ADA stalls for passengers with disabilities, as well
