        As transit and passengers speed past the parking structure, the angled fins (screening) create a sense of movement that echoes the patterns of native riparian grasses.                            </p>

        The façade allows natural light to filter through at varying degrees, enlivening the interior spaces throughout, and delighting the eye of travelers within the structure, as well as those passing by at the exterior.

        At the ground level, a mix of materials, including metal screening, perforated box-rib metal panels and brick, along with landscaping, evokes a design language from Sumner’s historic downtown. Generous canopies and a seating area recessed into the building provide refuge from inclement weather.

        The open design pattern sheltering the parking structure is inspired by natural elements found in the forests of the Pacific Northwest. The unique screening creates dynamic interchanges of light and shadow, acting as both windbreak and sunshade while still allowing natural ventilation.

          The intermittent horizontal bands emphasize the activity and movement around the structure, while providing visual breaks in the overall building height. Textured board-formed concrete walls modulate the building’s length with changes in material and height.

        The south entrance portal is marked by signage integrated into the canopy, creating a dedicated entry point for buses to safely pass through. Brick wraps around the building continuing to line the pedestrian path along Station Lane.

        The weather-protected stair tower will feature art in the stair glazing on its north façade and allow light to pass through brick patterned glass elements on the west side.  Glass on the east provides views into the two elevators provided.

            The intermittent horizontal bands emphasize the activity and movement around the structure, while providing a visual break over the building’s height.

            The interlaced lines spanning the structure’s few short stories cascade soft shadows from Sumner’s sunlight, giving breath to a variety of ever-changing light qualities throughout the day. The weather-protected stair tower will feature art and allow light to pass through thoughtfully placed glass bricks.             </p>
